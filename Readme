Auth Server Backend Starter Project Created with Golang 

Starting the APP

1. docker-compose up  (To start the Postgres DB container)
2. make migrate  (To run the DB migrations, There is a basic users table)
3. go run cmd/api/*.go  (Starts the application)

The Golang app can also be built with docker as a container.  A sample Dockerfile
is in the project.  The DB Flag should be changed to the commented out DB Flag
for Docker. 

Flags and DB schemas should not be checked into source control but are added here
as an example in this project.
